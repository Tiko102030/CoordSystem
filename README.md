## What is this program?

This program was designed to encode Latitude/Longitude coordinates into words from a given words list. The combinations can then be shared in a more easy-to-understand format, and decoded.

By using a custom wordslist as the key, this program can be used to encrypt coordinates.

## How do I use a custom wordslist?

To use a custom wordslist for more secretive encryption, you can replace the list in the source code. In the future I plan on adding that as a feature.
